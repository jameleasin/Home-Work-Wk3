Using HTML, CSS and Javascript I've created an application that randomly generates a password based on user selected criteria.
The user is able to confirm or deny characters within their password aswell as determine the length of the password between 8-128 characters.
If the selection criteria is all denied and the password lenth is outside of the scope, the user is prompted to retry.
Once the password characters are defined they are then concatinated to one another then run through a Math.random until the length of the password determined by the user is reached.
The password is then displayed in the display box on the main webpage.
